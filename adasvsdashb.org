*** Application Onboarding Dashboard
**** What
- First point dashboard for interaction with ADA Platform toolchain
- One point dashboard for ADA DevOps activities
- User Onboardking, Credentials Module , Infra Operations and DevOps dashboard

**** Why
- Scalability : put the control back into process - to make it scalable and agile
- Reduced Human intervention to avoid Human errors, Traceability
- Audit Trail and Traceability

**** How
- DevOps Admin Dashboard
- Onboarding Users Dashboard
- Onboarding Applications Workflow

| Authentication through Reg1 LDAP | Authorization through vault | Functional IDs, Keytabs | Authentication Through SVC LDAP | Access to ADA Cluster Resources |
|                                  |                             |                         |                                 |                                 |

**** Challenges
- Security , Various User Interactions and Credentials management in encrypted security solution
- Segregation of Accountability and Control
- Change control mechanism - TS, ITSS, DevOps toolchain interactions
  - CR/Full control with DevOps
  - Process to be discussed, finalized and integrated with CQ

**** MVP
- Current
  - Dashboard for DevOps Admins
  - Add Remove Users safely
  - Add Remove Groups safely
  - Generate and secure save Keytabs
- Future
  - Security implementation for Admin, User modules
  - Microservice security
  - Change Control
  - Onboarding Users
  - User's Keytab download section and email functionality
  - Configuring Services

*** CI CD for Applications
*** CI CD for Infrastructure Configuration Management
*** Openshift Migration of Compute
*** DevOps Observabilit and Metrices
**** What
- Consolidated numerical metrices of Real time services status
- Uptime, Downtime Metrices Hourly, Daily, Monthly, Yearly
- Mean time to restore, Mean time to detect
**** Why
- Lead time between detection and remedial actions
- Identification of vulnerable services, bottlenecks
- Automated reports of KPI(s) and Controls of ADA Platform as a whole
- Event streams and Incident reporting

**** How
