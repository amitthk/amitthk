yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.dept1.maximum-capacity



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
yarn.scheduler.capacity.<queue-path>.capacity	

Queue capacity in percentage (%) as a float (e.g. 12.5). 
The sum of capacities for all queues, at each level, must be equal to 100. Applications in the queue may consume more resources than the queue’s capacity if there are free resources, providing elasticity.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
yarn.scheduler.capacity.<queue-path>.maximum-capacity

Maximum queue capacity in percentage (%) as a float. 
This limits the elasticity for applications in the queue.
Defaults to -1 which disables it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
yarn.scheduler.capacity.<queue-path>.minimum-user-limit-percent	
Each queue enforces a limit on the percentage of resources allocated to a user at any given time, if there is demand for resources. The user limit can vary between a minimum and maximum value. The the former (the minimum value) is set to this property value and the latter (the maximum value) depends on the number of users who have submitted applications. For e.g., suppose the value of this property is 25. If two users have submitted applications to a queue, no single user can use more than 50% of the queue resources. If a third user submits an application, no single user can use more than 33% of the queue resources. With 4 or more users, no user can use more than 25% of the queues resources. A value of 100 implies no user limits are imposed. The default is 100. Value is specified as a integer.

yarn.scheduler.capacity.<queue-path>.user-limit-factor	
The multiple of the queue capacity which can be configured to allow a single user to acquire more resources.
By default this is set to 1 which ensures that a single user can never take more than the queue’s configured capacity irrespective of how idle th cluster is. Value is specified as a float.

yarn.scheduler.capacity.<queue-path>.maximum-allocation-mb	

The per queue maximum limit of memory to allocate to each container request at the Resource Manager. 
This setting overrides the cluster configuration yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-mb. This value must be smaller than or equal to the cluster maximum.



yarn.scheduler.capacity.<queue-path>.maximum-allocation-vcores	

The per queue maximum limit of virtual cores to allocate to each container request at the Resource Manager. This setting overrides the cluster configuration yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-vcores. This value must be smaller than or equal to the cluster maximum.
