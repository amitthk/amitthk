* CA RA (deployment automation) vs Ansible (confguration management)

|                          | CA Release Automation                                                                         | Ansible Deployment                                                           |
| Parameter Passing        | The Parameters are set in JIRA, then passed to Jenkins, Then passed to shell script and so on | Directly passed from group_vars or host_vars yaml files                      |
| Hand off of control      | Multiple hand offs                                                                            | Centralized at the Jenkins/Ansible controller                                |
| Logging                  | Decentralized at multiple places                                                              | Centralized at Jenkins                                                       |
| Reporting                | Logs and status are at multiple places, difficult to implement                                | Full deployment Logs emailed to stakeholders                                 |
| Security                 | Integrated to Reg1 and CyberArk, Jenkins credentials                                          | Integrated to Reg1, CyberArk and Vault                                       |
| Release model            | Multiple locations for code, CA RA deployments, CA RA Configurations (bitbucket) etc.         | Centralized to Bitbucket and Vault                                           |
| Traceability             | Disintregrated and decentralized                                                              | Co-located at the source control sytem (bitbucket)                           |
| Parallelism              | Depends upon CA RA Master and Agents assembly                                                 | Depends upon number of agents that can be spawn to run Ansible (dynamic)     |
| Configuration management | Decentralized                                                                                 | Centralized                                                                  |
| Ease of Understanding    | Complex Parameterizing mechanism and shell scripting                                          | YAML based DSL, well documented industry standard                            |
| Runtime types            | Multiple, Jenkinsfile(s), CA RA Deployments, shell scripts, custom tools                      | Jenkinsfile, Ansible playbooks, Python                                       |
| Licensing                | CA                                                                                            | Open Source                                                                  |
| Maintenance              | ITSS sets up deployments, JIRA, bugfights deployments                                         | One time setup, ITSS Release team to trigger, Fully traceable in from source |
