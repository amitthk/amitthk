**** Understanding what's happening & addressing it.

1. You're stretching your eyes, once you're in flow of some work over the time.
Put eyes open wide. Concentrated.

2. You're stretching, twitching your forehead.
Keep the forehead relaxed.

3. You're pulling your ears up and stretching your temples.
Keep ears and temples relaxed.

4. You're tensing the back of your neck.
Keep neck & spine straight & relaxed.

5. You're getting restless
Stillness.

6. Energies are getting too negative.
Be proactive. Maintain high positive energy.

If you bring awareness to it - it is just a tingling sensation. At time of control, tingling isn't really there or is low, ignorable. Reflexes are just of habit. More prominent the sensation is - stronger concentration you need. Be seriously concentrated if need be.  

Bad habits must be replaced with good habits.
Strictly Stop restless legs.

Sleepiness/drowsiness is a big culprit. If you had your sleep well it ticks are under total control.
Stillness, concentration and proactive-ness still helps. Do the 5min. Stillness trataka.

7. Confused/stressed
Its all in mind. Keep calm, still and concentrate on your thoughts & energy. Move out of the body. Observe it from third perspective.

8. Habit is difficult to nail down.
Concentrate, hold tight to stillness. Switch of the mind - total silence. If body is experiencing something observe it objectively. Don't get involved with it. Don't do it yourself - neither try to stop it. Observe it calmly.

8. Disoriented
More prominent the sensation is - stronger concentration you need. Be seriously concentrated if need be. 

7. Mind is producing negative thoughts & emotional energy.
Switch Mind off at your will. Stop creating anything at all.

8. Body mind and energies feel out of sync & in confusion.
Awareness. Maintain general feeling of Satisfaction, restfulness & pleasantness. 

9. Energies are low
Concentrate your energies at the mast of your head. Charge your aura with positive energy and wield it like a shield around you.

Smile. You're bigger than any situation that you have created. If you created it - you can control it.

- backup samba config
rsync /etc/samba/smb.conf administrator@192.168.0.109:/Users/administrator/Documents/src

*** getting list of all hostnames in lan
  // unknown was orangepi
 nmap -sP 192.168.1.* 

*** setup samba 
  sudo apt-get install samba samba-common-bin

 sudo mkdir -m 1777 /data-share

**** backup the samba config file
 sudo mv /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.$(date +%F)

**** cleanup and create the fresh smb.conf
   sudo grep -ve ^# -ve '^;' -ve ^$ smb.conf.2016-03-08 > smb.conf

**** Go into bash and add the data share directory to the end of smb.conf
 sudo bash
 sudo nano smb.conf

 ==> add the following data
 [data]
         comment = Data share
         path = /data-share
         browseable = yes
         read only = no

 ==> test the config
 testparm

 ==> add samba user
 sudo smbpasswd -a pi


*** setup network
**** Option 1

Just edit /etc/network/interfaces and write:

auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp 
                wpa-ssid {ssid}
                wpa-psk  {password}
After that write and close file and use command:

sudo dhclient wlan0
Replace {ssid} and {password} with your respective WiFi SSID and password.

**** Option 2

This is going to be more of a 1. Assuming your Wireless network card is wlan0 2. Assuming your Wireless network is "Wifi2Home" 2. Assuming your Wireless network key is ASCII code ABCDE12345

First, get your WiFi card up and running:

sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
Now scan for a list of WiFi networks in range. You might be typing your name wr$

sudo iwlist wlan0 scan
This will show you a list of wireless networks, pick yours from the list:

sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid Wifi2Home key s:ABCDE12345
To obtain the IP address, now request it with the Dynamic Host Client:

sudo dhclient wlan0
You should then be connected to the WiFi network. The first option is better, because it will be able to run as a cron job to start up the wifi whenever you need it going. If you need to turn off your WiFi for whatever reason, just type:

sudo ifconfig wlan0 down

**** Option 3
- sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces.d/wlan0

- //add following
auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
wpa-ssid groundnet
wpa-psk e995b6d38127c3fdc819e90ccbe5dab54198cea5c592426d85933c13905d92b8

if-down ifconfig eth0 up

- sudo chmod u+s /bin/ping

- sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf

nameserver 192.168.0.1
nameserver 192.168.0.2
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4



*** setup samba
1. Install:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install samba samba-common-bin


2. Create share directory:
sudo mkdir -m 1777 /data-share

/******

    1: sets the sticky bit. This set on a directory ensures that users can only delete files they own.
    7: sets RWX read , write and execute for the user owner
    7: sets RWX read , write and execute for the group owner
    7: sets RWX read , write and execute for others

******/


3. Backup smb.conf
sudo mv /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.$(date +%F)

4. Now copy back the trim down smb.conf with share directory information

sudo bash
grep -ve ^# -ve â€˜^;â€™ -ve ^$ smb.conf.2015-12-07   >  smb.conf

5.  Edit /etc/samba/smb.conf .Add the share information :

[data]
        comment = Data share
        path = /data-share
        browseable = yes
        read only = no

6. Test config:
testparm

7. Restart samba:-
service samba restart

if that doesn't work:

sudo /etc/init.d/smbd start

8. Create samba users:-

smbpasswd -a root
smbpasswd -a pi

*** static ip
- backup interfaces file
sudo cp /etc/network/interfaces /etc/network/interfaces.bak

-  updat the /etc/network/interfaces file

 sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces

-> If this line is there - comment it out
iface eth0 inet dhcp

-> Update the static ip
 # The loopback interface
 auto lo
 iface lo inet loopback
 auto eth0
 iface eth0 inet static
 #your static IP (required)
 address 192.168.1.118  
 #your gateway IP
 gateway 192.168.1.1
 netmask 255.255.255.0 (required)
 #your network address "family"
 network 192.168.1.0
 broadcast 192.168.1.255


- restart the network service
sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart

OR

sudo /etc/init.d/networking reload

- check the status in ifconfig

*** setup hostname
 sudo nano /etc/hosts
 sudo nano /etc/hostname

 sudo reboot




*** connect to ec2

 ssh -i 'Box Sync'/Docs/amitthk_aws_keypair.pem  ec2-user@ec2-52-36-166-157.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com

*** install mysql

**** create busybox repository:-
 sudo docker run -v /var/lib/mysql --name=mysql_datastore -d busybox
 echo 'My Datastore'

**** use the repository and start mysql
 sudo docker run --name d-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=ditstudent --volumes-from mysql_datastore  -d mysql

**** install wordpress and point it to above mysql instance. also set the port accordingly
 sudo docker run --link=d-mysql:mysql -p 8983:80 -d wordpress

**** nginx on docker
 $ docker run --name amitthk-nginx -v /some/content:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro -d nginx




*** apt-get de-install broken packages

**** Approach 1
 Make a backup of /var/lib/dpkg/status:

 sudo cp /var/lib/dpkg/status /var/lib/dpkg/status.bkup

 Open /var/lib/dpkg/status:

 sudo nano /var/lib/dpkg/status

 Search through the file for any reference to that package name (i.e. linux-headers-3.0.0-19) and CAREFULLY delete that entry. Don't delete anything else. Save the file and quite.

 Do sudo apt-get update.

**** Approach 2

 If you get nowhere with any of the other offerings I've used this in the past

 dpkg --remove --force-remove-reinstreq
 From the dpkg manual

 remove-reinstreq: Remove a package, even if it's broken
 So run:

 sudo dpkg --remove --force-remove-reinstreq  linux-headers-3.0.0-19


 https://askubuntu.com/questions/122699/how-to-remove-package-in-bad-state-software-center-freezes-no-synaptic/122737#122737?newreg=4bfa6d05048c478a814a2a80dd8c109c


*** kernel modules
**** list the modules:-
 uname -r

**** should match the libraries:-
 ls /lib/modules

**** Else compile the latest
 sudo aptitude install linux-image-rpi-rpfv linux-headers-rpi-rpfv



*** httpd

 httpd -V
 sudo nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
 sudo nano /etc/httpd/logs/error_log
 sudo service httpd restart

 sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/wordpress
 sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/vhosts/blog



*** fdisk resize partition

From the command line or a terminal window enter the following

sudo fdisk /dev/mmcblk0
then type p to list the partition table

you should see two partitions. if you look in the last column labeled System you should have

Linux

make a note of the start number for partiton 2, you will need this later. though it will likely still be on the screen (just in case).

next type d to delete a partition.

You will then be prompted for the number of the partition you want to delete. In the case above you want to delete both the Linux and Linux swap partitions.

So type 2

Now you can resize the main partition.

type n to create a new partition.

This new partition needs to be a primary partition so type p.

Next enter 2 when prompted for a partition number.

You will now be prompted for the first sector for the new partition. Enter the start number from the earlier step (the Linux partition)

Next you will be prompted for the last sector you can just hit enter to accept the default which will utilize the remaining disk space.

Type w to save the changes you have made.

Next reboot the system with the following command:

sudo reboot
once the system has reboot and you are back at the commandline enter the following command:

sudo resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p2

*** Install tightvncserver

You'll be able to control it as though you were working on the Raspberry Pi itself.

On your Pi (using a monitor or via SSH), install the TightVNC package:

sudo apt-get install tightvncserver
Next, run TightVNC Server which will prompt you to enter a password and an optional view-only password:

tightvncserver
Start a VNC server from the terminal: This example starts a session on VNC display one (:1) with full HD resolution:

vncserver :1 -geometry 1920x1080 -depth 24
Note that since by default an X session is started on display zero, you will get an error in case you use :0.

Since there are now two X sessions running, which would normally be a waste of resources, it is suggested to stop the displaymanager running on :0 using

service lightdm stop
Now, on your computer, install and run the VNC client:

On a Linux machine install the package xtightvncviewer:
sudo apt-get install xtightvncviewer

**** shortcut script
to remember it:

Create a file containing the following shell script:

#!/bin/sh
vncserver :1 -geometry 1920x1080 -depth 24 -dpi 96
Save this as vnc.sh (for example)

Make the file executable:

chmod +x vnc.sh
Then you can run it at any time with:

./vnc.sh
If you prefer your mouse pointer in the VNC client to appear as an arrow as opposed to an "x" which is default, in ./vnc/xstartup add the following parameter to xsetroot:

-cursor_name left_ptr

**** run at boot

To run at boot:

Log into a terminal on the Pi as root:

sudo su
Navigate to the directory /etc/init.d/:

cd /etc/init.d/
Create a new file here containing the following script:

#! /bin/sh
# /etc/init.d/vncboot

### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides: vncboot
# Required-Start: $remote_fs $syslog
# Required-Stop: $remote_fs $syslog
# Default-Start: 2 3 4 5
# Default-Stop: 0 1 6
# Short-Description: Start VNC Server at boot time
# Description: Start VNC Server at boot time.
### END INIT INFO

USER=pi
HOME=/home/pi

export USER HOME

case "$1" in
 start)
  echo "Starting VNC Server"
  #Insert your favoured settings for a VNC session
  su - $USER -c "/usr/bin/vncserver :1 -geometry 1280x800 -depth 16 -pixelformat rgb565"
  ;;

 stop)
  echo "Stopping VNC Server"
  /usr/bin/vncserver -kill :1
  ;;

 *)
  echo "Usage: /etc/init.d/vncboot {start|stop}"
  exit 1
  ;;
esac

exit 0
Save this file as vncboot (for example)

Make this file executable:

chmod 755 vncboot
Enable dependency-based boot sequencing:

# update-rc.d lightdm remove
update-rc.d vncboot defaults

Emacs Quick Reference

This quick reference assumes that you are using the Emacs provided for the course. Emacs may behave differently for some of these key bindings if you have setup Emacs yourself.  By convention, holding down the CTRL key and x together is represented as C-x.  Likewise, pressing the ESC key and then x is represented as M-x (you can also press the ALT key together with x).

- General

C-x C-c	Quit Emacs
C-g	Quit Current Command
M-x	Run an Emacs Command

- File Operations

C-x C-f	Open/Create File
C-x k	Close File
C-x C-s	Save File

- Editing

C-x u	Undo
Shift-Del	Cut
Ctrl-Ins	Copy
Shift-Ins	Paste
C-s	Interactive Search
TAB	Indent Current Line
C-M-\	Indent Selection

- Buffers

C-x b	Switch Buffers
C-x C-b	Get a List of Buffers
C-x o	Switch to Other Window
C-x 1	Close Other Window
C-x 2	Split the Screen Horizontally

- SML Process

M-x sml	Start SML interpreter
C-c C-s	Switch to SML interpreter
C-c C-l	Load a file into SML interpreter
C-c C-r	Send current selection to SML interpreter
C-c C-b	Send current buffer to SML interpreter
C-c `	Browse through source file for next error
C-c C-d	Tell the interactive session to terminate

C-c C-d toggle auto hungry mode in which emacs deletes groups of spaces with one del-press
C-c C-u go to beginning of this preprocessor statement
C-c C-c comment out marked area
More general (I guess)
M-x outline-minor-mode collapses function definitions in a file to a mere {...} 
M-x show-subtree If you are in one of the collapsed functions, this un-collapses it 
In order to achive some of the feats coming up now you have to run etags *.c *.h *.cpp (or what ever ending you source files have) in the source directory
M-. (Thats Meta dot) If you are in a function call, this will take you to it's definition 
M-x tags-search ENTER Searches through all you etaged 
M-, (Meta comma) jumps to the next occurence for tags-search 
M-x tags-query-replace yum. This lets you replace some text in all the tagged files

****** 5 Step process of reading~

  Start with a comfortable and straight posture. Reading a new material is an active sport (revision can be passive sport also.).  Sit still, calm, take a deep breath, smile and concentrate.

  5 steps to Reading:-
  1. Scaffolding: Get a clear High Level Overview/Helicopter View - the complete flow of the material.
  2. Skimming: Fast fluid eye movements through content. Quick overview/Overall thought process of the material. Switch back & forth between high-level view and content of material. Feel the thought process. Filling in Helicopter view. Understanding of new terms.
  3. Deep diving: Thorough read each sentence - pause and understand the thought clearly.  Mark action words/keywords. Create mind map of keywords - connect the thoughts. Switch back & forth between high-level view & content.
  4. Tip-tapping: - tap, tap, tap the keywords - invoke the thoughts and Go!
  5. Reviewing:
  - Learning is incomplete without review and recall.
  - Always review, recall after session - if you cannor recall immediately, would you recal later?

****** Reading stumbling blocks->

******* Eye Fixations: more eye fixations you have - slower the speed & faster you sleep.

******* Eye Span: bigger your eye span better comprehension (you get the thought as a whole)

******* Regression: 

******* Sub vocalization:

  - Brain is attracted to movement
  - In reading championships they use visual guide.


***** Productivity factors  - Nishant Kashibhatla
******* Expert power
  Lifelong learning
  Specialized Knowledge - something that the market needs
******* 3 Critical Skills
  - Super memory -> Register, Retain, Recall
  - Speed Reading 
  - Laser Sharp Focus -> Focus one and only one thing at a time and really win the game.

  More you learn - more you earn. Faster you learn, faster ou earn.

***** Memory 4 Factors
******* Belief
  -- I have a great memory.
  -- It's OK. I'll rememver it the next time.
******* Attention
  -- 100% pure and undivided attention
  -- For(get) because - they didn't really 'get' it in the first place.
  -- Single Tasking - multitasking is bad for attention. Reduce your choices.
******* Association
******* Action
  More you remember, more you can remember.

***** Rules for focus

****** Reduce your choices. 
  More choices we have lesser focus. 'Decision fatigue' if too
  many choices on unimportant activities. Save your choice power for worthwhile tasks.

****** Remember 80:20 principle/pareto principle.
  What are those 20% activity that I must do which gives me 80% results.

****** Rules & Rituals

******* Rules : if this then that rules list

******* Rituals: Design your morning ritual. 
  If your morning is great, your day will be great. If your day is great
  your week will be great. If your weeks are great your month - year -
  your life will be great.

  Start your day like a winner.

**** Review 10 Things You Can Do Today To Increase Your Productivity

1. Write down your mind. No offence to your dynamite intelligence. But is it really worth occupying your psychic RAM (memory) with trivial stuff which could easily be organized on a piece of paper? Besides all the secrets inside your head are still ambiguous, amorphous, wishy washy stuff for others - until you clear the ground. Use the power of pen & paper.

2. Remember only 20% of your actions result in 80% of results that matter. Always ask yourself, is this the task (I am working on) really something that produces maximum results which matter? If you find yourself involved in activities that produce none or low value outcome/results - Just Stop - just leave it right there and forget about it. Move on to top priority task of the moment.

3. If something requires less than two minutes to do, do it immediately. Develop the habit of motion. Most of the things can be done right on the spot rather than putting them on your todo list and letting them hang in there for paralysis of analysis.

4. Start with this sequence of questions. 1. "Why" am I doing what I am doing?  > 2. "How" will I go about doing this (plan, commitment and quality of results) ? > 3. "What" I will do (next finite actions)?

5. However huge your plan is - ask yourself and write down on paper -> "What is the NEXT ACTION you must take?" to progress to level of this thought.

6. Cultivate a "Letâ€™s go and take a look!" attitude.  Sometimes a quick visit to the field can teach you more than a week spent analysing numbers, sitting comfortably at your desk. 

7. Abstain from using bad language at workplace. This is an old hat advise which stems from pure common sense - not using bad language will never offend anyone. Using it sometimes might offend someone. Abstain and you will perhaps avoid conflicts or difficult situations. Besides using bad language is an unpredictably lethal habit.

8. Just Begin. Start working on it even if it looks like trivial at start. Soon you will pick up the momentum. But first - you must get it started. Stop thinking & start doing.

9. Close the loop.  Ask yourself -Is everything all right? Update others also and put a proper closure to all your actions. Don't leave others waiting  on - "we will call you later if we run into problems".

10. Recognize when it has all been said.

**** Bring in your game checklist
- Learn to be still. You must be able to maintain 5 minutes of absolute stillness.
- Carry aura of highly positive energy. Keep your energies in contended, successful zone.  Radiate your positive aura and reflect your enthusiasm in your eyes. Feel the positive energy. Radiate intelligence.
- Pull your energy at the mast of your head. Your energies speaks far ahead of you speak.
- Absolute Self-Descipline, Spontaneity and Consistent results is the key.
- Relax, ease it up, slow down & be aware of the moment. Tense muscle wastes energy, save energies for important duties. Maintain an erect but comfortable posture. Be absolutely comfortable inside your skin. Feet flat grounded - no fidgeting.
- For every stuff that disturbs your stillness -  Observe it to utmost depth. Put your absolute concentration to keep returning it to your course with calm stillness And no signs of worry.
- Perform tasks with intense dedication & spontaneity - with the least show of effort on your face/body.
- Keep a stoical mind. Expressionless face. Turn your mind on and off on your will.
- Offense is the best defence. Be offensive/aggressive towards finishing the task. Keep sense of urgency alive - remember the time is relative and it is already very less.
- Be completely still inside. Find your inner stillness and keep it. Mind is a chaos, but you must hold on to stillness.
- 60 seconds of absolute life in every minute.
- Don't wait for inspiration, create it. Stop thinking start doing it. Get started somehow, regardless of how mundane at beginning - then pick it up.
- Begin the day with reading something technical and inspiring.
- Observe every thought. Keep a mental record of every passerby.
- When in doubt - write it down and keep it in your in basket. When in confusion write it down and keep it in your in basket. Always journal.
- Consistency and spontaneity must sustain. One time achiever or bright sparks achievers seldom make it long.
- Identify the aura of your energy and keep it open, calm, clean and white. Radiate it around you all the time.
- Be very very practical with use of your mind. Put the body absolutely still. Erect posture but absolutely relaxed.
- Absolutely calm and assured in heart, stoic/poised face, light smile of clarity and understanding on face.
- Keep your conscious far and wide aware of surroundings.
- Never go in a zone. Once you are in zone, you loose track of time and time is wasted. If you are going into zone - close the eyes take a deep breath and do anulom vilom for few minutes. Every moment must deliver the best in your consciousness.
- When you have a clear plan, and you are consciously and clearly acting upon it - none of surrounding consciousness (or so called fate) can effect you.
- Never strengthen negative consciousness around you by giving it undue attention and never bring it onboard. Rather flare it away by brandishing your positive consciousness.
- flank open your positive energies brandishing, twirl it around and wield it like a shield around you. Hold the ground tight, take the position and be absolutely still. Be totally inside the shield and absolutely observant still calm and patient.
