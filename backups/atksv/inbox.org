 Dear Sir,

 I would request a Medical leave today as I am not feeling well. I caught cold and flu somewhere.  

 Went to doctor yesterday thought it would be fine by morning but I think I won't be able to sit comfortably in office so I would take rest.

 I am reachable on my handphone +65-91319851 and Skype.

 Best Regards,
 AmitPython, J
